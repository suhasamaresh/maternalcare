# Solana Appointment Booking System üìÖ‚ú®

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project integrated with [Solana](https://solana.com/) to facilitate decentralized transactions. The application allows users to book appointments with doctors by sending **0.01 SOL** directly from the user's wallet to the doctor's wallet. All doctor and user data is securely stored on the **blockchain**. 

In the future, we aim to extend this functionality by implementing a **user dashboard** to enhance the experience. For now, the focus is on **secure transactions** between wallets.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

First, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn dev
# or
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Solana-powered transactions**: Easily send **0.01 SOL** for booking appointments.
- **Blockchain data storage**: Doctor and user data is stored on Solana blockchain.
- **Next.js & TypeScript**: Leverage modern web technologies for a seamless experience.
- **Web3.js**: Interact with the Solana blockchain efficiently.

## üîß Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework for server-side rendering and building scalable web apps.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Type-safe development.
- [Solana](https://solana.com/): High-performance blockchain for decentralized transactions.
- [Web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/): Library to interact with the Solana blockchain.

## ‚ú® How It Works
